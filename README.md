# Computer Vision Algorithms

Implementation and analysis of classical computer vision algorithms, with emphasis on
algorithmic understanding, parameter selection, and failure-mode analysis.

The repository focuses on implementing core vision pipelines and analyzing their behavior
under different conditions, rather than relying on black-box library functions.
